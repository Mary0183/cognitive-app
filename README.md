# About

WayToGo! app aims to improve the way people percieve their every day to day life in a more positive way. Through a perfectly build form and a colorful checkbox you can document activities you did during the day that made you feel good about yourself and then select from a list one or more positive traits or emotions that matches that activity.

# How do you document your activities and traits or emotions

WayToGo! app is divided into three main parts:

\*The Input Form

Is where you are going to type the activity that made you feel good about yourself

\*The Positive Traits Checkbox List
